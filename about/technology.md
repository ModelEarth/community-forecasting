# Fun Facts about our Forecasting Tools

We use the highly efficient <b>DBSCAN++ clustering algorithm</b> to process in realtime.  

Our poster is generated using a giant webpage designed to create unique posters for zipcodes.  

We developed a JSON reader that converts heirachy lists to HTML for our cluster buckets.  

We use the same reader with the <b>DiffBot Knowledge Graph API</b> to list industries by zip code.  

Our GitHub pages use <b>Markdown-to-HTML</b> to build webpages from multiple files.  

Our tables are displayed using CSV-to-HTML via D3.

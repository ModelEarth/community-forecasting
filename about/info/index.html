<h2>Data Sources</h2>
Data is provided by the US Census and FBI. We make no claims to the accuracy of the data, nor to the accuracy of the 
predictions based on the data.

<h2>Data Processing</h2>

Community datasets from 2012-2016 have been processed and consolidated into a single dataset consumable by our forecasting model. Processing the data across geographies enables the forecasting model to more robustly capture underlying patterns across locations with otherwise sparse data. Combining the annual data into a single, cohesive dataset permits a proper linear regression time series analysis.

<h2>No Guarantees</h2>

Our site uses previous US Census data to predict future economic conditions. 
In using this site, you agreee that Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results and 
that any future projection is purely speculaition and should not be used to make decisions.

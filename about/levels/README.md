## Addressing Persistent Poverty

Approximately 13% of census tracts in the United States are facing persistent poverty - defined by 20 percent of the population living in poverty for the last 30 years.  (Crandall 2015, Neighborhood Scale)  

The rate of poverty has stedily declined:  

1960 - 2,083 counties  
1990 - 765 counties  
2011 - 488 counties  


“In 1960, a total of 2,083 rural counties had 20% or more of their population
living below the poverty level. By 1990, the number had shrunk to 765, a
decline of nearly two-thirds and an indication of the remarkable reduction of
poverty across rural America.”

"To provide national context for such analysis, we
have classified all ZIP-code areas according to their poverty levels as reported in the
2000 Census: high poverty = poverty rate of 20 percent or more; medium = 11-20
percent; and low = 10 percent or less."  

"A poverty rate of 30 or 40 percent is customarily used to demarcate high-poverty census tracts.
However, ZIP codes encompass much larger territories and rarely have poverty rates that high.
We estimate that a 20 percent poverty rate is a more appropriate threshold for isolating highpoverty areas at the ZIP code level."  

"In 2002, about half of all establishments and jobs were located in low-poverty areas. Even though almost three times as many jobs were available in the low-poverty areas, the ratio of jobs to population was almost the same (390 jobs per 1,000 people)."  

1998 and 2000 high-poverty areas  
1.2% annual job growth (3.7% low poverty)  

2000 to 2002 high-poverty areas  
1.5% annual job loss (0% low poverty)

Our observation:
In 2017, only 238 jobs (as is) in County Business Patterns (CBP) data.

"County Business Patterns (CBP) covers most NAICS industries excluding crop and animal production; rail transportation; National Postal Service; pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; private households; and public administration. CBP also excludes most establishments reporting government employees."

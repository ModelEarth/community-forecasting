Based on your selected indicators and industries, 
we'll form <b>DBSCAN</b> clusters of zip codes which you can apply   
to find opportunities and generate mailing lists <!--within your local browser to filter results -->
for program marketing campaigns. 

Our focus area filters are seeded with <b>Random Forest</b> importance indicators using job and income levels, employment levels across multiple industries, work experience, education level, crime stats, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">and poverty</span> levels for adults, children <span style="white-space:nowrap;">and seniors</span>.<br><br>

Our community forecasting model is trained using time series Census and FBI data from 2012 to 2016. Each indicator's performance is compared to prior <!-- two-->years to generate projected estimates for the next 5 years. Projections are
<span style="white-space:nowrap">based</span> on a cross validated <span style="white-space:nowrap"><b>Lasso Regression</b></span> Least Angle Regression (LARS) forward-selection algorithm.

<!--
Our community forecasting model is predicated upon projecting current feature values based on the prior two years of data across all available features in the time series dataset.  Each featureâ€™s resultant model is used to predict forward estimates over the subsequent 5 year period. Our core model is based on a cross validated Lasso regression using the LARS algorithm which helps automatically optimize both feature weightings and the regularization parameter. We use this approach to improve generalizability and prevent potential overfitting caused both by regionally specific and recent historical trends.
